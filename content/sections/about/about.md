Hello! My name is Joshua and I enjoy building things that live on the internet. I am a software engineer with a passion for creating things that make a difference. 

My journey started in healthcare, where I worked as a physical therapy aide and witnessed the transformative power of technology. I was determined to bring my skills and passion together in the world of software development. Having recently completed UC Berkeley's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp and a strong foundation in Javascript, I am always eager to learn new technologies and tackle new challenges. I am excited to join like-minded individuals who share my passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

Currently, I am a software engineer intern involved in design decisions, focusing on building an accessible, people-focused experience at Jetsweat for a variety of clients. I've recently deployed features that increase subscription conversion and reduce cart abandonment.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or taking photos.
